    As of now, the vmConsole application is distributed only through Google
    Play Store. Click on the badge below to proceed to the installation page.

  <p>
    It is planned to enable distribution of the application through GitHub
    Releases in future, so people without Google Services will be able to
    install it as well. Also this will allow us to provide a version of
    vmConsole without certain restrictions.
  </p>

  <h2>System Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    These system requirements are not mandatory. Though on devices where
    they are met, you will be able to achieve the max from application.
    Remember that vmConsole is a virtual machine holding the full-blown
    Linux distribution. Do not be naive, this application IS NOT optimized
    for low-end devices.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Disk: 8 GiB minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assuming you will have one 6 GiB partition on persistent disk
        and leave some space for Android. Note that vmConsole provides
        2 persistend disks with max size of 32 GiB. You will be able to
        use both fully if have more than 64 GiB free on shared storage.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        RAM: 6 - 8 GB.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having more is good only for overall Android multitasking.
        vmConsole automatically determines a safe amount of memory that
        it can allocate, but it has a hard limit of 2047 MiB, which
        partially is a technical limitation (32bit devices) and partially
        a safe threshold that will let Android multitasking function
        properly without OOM conditions.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It is suggested to run vmConsole on 64bit devices, as it has been
    observed that QEMU has better emulation performance on these. But
    that is unclear, especially in cases where device is 64bit with
    32bit only support on Android OS. Possibly that on devices having
    good CPU, the performace between 32bit and 64bit variants will be
    little to no.
